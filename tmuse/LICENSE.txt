Description of the resource

This archive contains a dump of a set of 22,722 local graphs built from a large Mandarin Chinese lexical graph. To each entry in the resources corresponds a local graph where vertices are semanticaly related words. In each of these graphs, vertices are connected by synonymy relations. Each vertex has a position in space and is included in a semantic cluster. It corresponds to the result of the computations made by the TMuse system for lexical resources exploration [1] using the Prox algorithm. For details or reference in scientific publication, please see the following papers [2] (short demo paper) and [3].

It was built based on synonymy data from the Chinese Wordnet [4] and from the Ministery of Education of Taiwan (MOE). Concerning the MOE data, we used the json version distributed by g0v.tw [5]

Description of the JSON format

Each entry consists of a clustering and a graph, here is a simple example :
{

#clustering_json is a list of clusters 
    "clustering_json": [
    {
        "labels": [
            [
            "\u65e9\u665a", 
        1.0
            ], 
        [
            "\u65e5\u5915", 
        0.8333333333333334
            ],
        (...)  
            [
            "\u9072\u65e9", 
        0.16666666666666666
            ]
            ]
    }
    ], 

#graph_json consists of nodes and edges
        "graph_json": {
            "nodes": [

            }
            ],  

#edges have a source 's' and a target 't' that are the indices of the connected nodes in the node list
